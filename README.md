## **Jonatas Ribeiro**

I am a seasoned professional with advanced expertise in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern front-end frameworks**. Additionally, I am comfortable working with server-side programming languages such as **Python and Node.js** for API development. 
<br/>
Currently, I am enhancing my skills through a Master's degree program in Computer Engineering, where I am delving into machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data using Python and other programming languages, and also Android mobile development with Kotlin and Flutter. 
<br/>
My career began as an Electronics Engineer specializing in Biomedical Engineering, telecommunication systems, and IoT, before transitioning into Software Engineering and web development. 
<br/>
In my role as an Engineer, I actively engage in academic pursuits and assist organizations in driving innovation through Research and Development of cutting-edge technologies. I excel in project management, quality assurance, and the implementation of clean code and software development best practices to foster continual improvement.
<br/>
IÂ´m also a surfer, a Rugby player, and a motorcycle enthusiast.
